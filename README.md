# Tweets-Analyser

Implemented a scalable word count application that uses the map-reduce computation model to analyse tweets in dataset.<br/>
Used Redis for efficient word count aggregation, with pipelines and Lua scripts to successfully handle massive data volumes.<br/>
Orchestrated a distributed architecture using a Raft cluster and three Redis instances for scalability and fault tolerance.<br/>
The application efficiently handles gigabytes of data, providing flawless analysis and insights extraction from tweet messages.
