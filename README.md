Implemented a scalable word count application that uses the map-reduce computation model to analyse tweets in dataset.\n
Used Redis for efficient word count aggregation, with pipelines and Lua scripts to successfully handle massive data volumes.\n
Orchestrated a distributed architecture using a Raft cluster and three Redis instances for scalability and fault tolerance.\n
The application efficiently handles gigabytes of data, providing flawless analysis and insights extraction from tweet messages.\n
